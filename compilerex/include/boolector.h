  Priint model to output file. This function prints the model for all inputs
  to the output file ``file``. Supported output formats for the model to be
  printed are: 

  * **btor**

    Use boolector's own output format for printing models.

    .. code-block:: c

      boolector_print_model (btor, "btor", stdout);

    A possible model would be: ::

      2 00000100 x
      3 00010101 y
      4[00] 01 A

    where the first column indicates the id of an input, the second column
    its assignment, and the third column its name (or symbol), if any.
    Note that in case that an input is an uninterpreted function or an
    array variable,
    values in square brackets indicate parameter resp. index values.

  * **smt2**

    Use `SMT-LIB v2`_ format for printing models.
 
    .. code-block:: c

      boolector_print_model (btor, "smt2", stdout);

    A possible model would be: ::

  Set option.
 
  List of available options:

  * **model_gen**

    | Enable (``value``: 1 or 2) or disable (``value``: 0) generation of a model for satisfiable instances. 
    | There are two modes for model generation: 

    * generate model for asserted expressions only (``value``: 1)
    * generate model for all expressions (``value``: 2)

  * **incremental**

    | Enable (``value``: 1) incremental mode.
    | Note that incremental usage turns off some optimization techniques. Disabling incremental usage is currently not supported.

  * **incremental_all**

    | Enable (``value``: 1) or disable (``value``: 0) incremental solving of all formulas when parsing an input file.
    | Note that currently, incremental mode while parsing an input file is only supported for `SMT-LIB v1`_ input.

  * **incremental_in_depth**

    | Set incremental in-depth mode width (``value``: int) when parsing an input file.
    | Note that currently, incremental mode while parsing an input file is only supported for `SMT-LIB v1`_ input.  

  * **incremental_look_ahead**

    | Set incremental look_ahead mode width (``value``: int) when parsing an input file.
    | Note that currently, incremental mode while parsing an input file is only supported for `SMT-LIB v1`_ input.
     
  * **incremental_interval**

    | Set incremental interval mode width (``value``: int) when parsing an input file.
    | Note that currently, incremental mode while parsing an input file is only supported for `SMT-LIB v1`_ input.

  * **input_format**
    
    | Force input file format (``value``: `BTOR <http://fmv.jku.at/papers/BrummayerBiereLonsing-BPR08.pdf>`_: -1, `SMT-LIB v1 <http://smtlib.cs.uiowa.edu/papers/format-v1.2-r06.08.30.pdf>`_: 1, `SMT-LIB v2 <http://smtlib.cs.uiowa.edu/papers/smt-lib-reference-v2.0-r12.09.09.pdf>`_: 2) when parsing an input file.
    | If unspecified, Boolector automatically detects the input file format while parsing.

  * **output_number_format**

    | Force output number format (``value``: binary: 0, hexadecimal: 1, decimal: 2):
    | Boolector uses binary by default.

  * **output_format**

    | Force output file format (``value``: BTOR_: -1, `SMT-LIB v1`_: 1, `SMT-LIB v2`_: 2).
    | Boolector uses BTOR_ by default.

  * **rewrite_level**

    | Set the rewrite level (``value``: 0-3) of the rewriting engine.
    | Boolector uses rewrite level 3 by default, rewrite levels are classified as follows:

    * 0: no rewriting
    * 1: term level rewriting
    * 2: more simplification techniques
    * 3: full rewriting/simplification

    | Do not alter the rewrite level of the rewriting engine after creating expressions.

  * **rewrite_level_pbr**

    | Set the rewrite level (``value``: 0-3) for partial beta reduction.
    | Boolector uses rewrite level 1 by default. Rewrite levels are classified as above.

  * **beta_reduce_all**
    
    Enable (``value``: 1) or disable (``value``: 0) the eager
    elimination of lambda expressions via beta reduction.

  * **probe_beta_reduce_all**

    Enable (``value``: 1) or disable (``value``: 0) probing of
    *beta_reduce_all* until a given lemmas on demand
    (*pbr_lod_limit*) or SAT conflicts limit (*pbra_sat_limit*).

  * **pbra_lod_limit**

    Set lemmas on demand limit for *probe_beta_reduce_all*.

  * **pbra_sat_limit**

    Set SAT conflicts limit for *probe_beta_reduce_all*.

  * **pbra_ops_factor**

    Set factor by which the size of the beta reduced formula may be
    greater than the original formula (for *probe_beta_reduce_all*).

  * **dual_prop**

    Enable (``value``: 1) or disable (``value``: 0) dual propagation
    optimization.

  * **just**

    Enable (``value``: 1) or disable (``value``: 0) justification
    optimization.
    
  * **ucopt**

    Enable (``value``: 1) or disable (``value``: 0) unconstrained
    optimization.

  * **lazy_synthesize**

    Enable (``value``: 1) or disable (``value``: 0) lazy synthesis of
    bit vector expressions.

  * **eliminate_slices**

    Enable (``value``: 1) or disable (``value``: 0) slice elimination
    on bit vector variables.
